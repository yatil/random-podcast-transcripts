[Music]

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello and welcome to the 28th edition of Random Pursuit on the Incomparable Networks Game Show,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
recorded in person at an undisclosed location.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Random Pursuit, a game that discards the board and shuffles trivia cards from lots and lots of trivia games.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm your scorekeeper, Stephen Chepanski, and now your host of this and every episode of Random Pursuit,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,360
Erica Ensign. Thank you, Stephen. As always, we have a lovely group of players and I will introduce

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,480
them in the order in which they will play. That order was, as always, determined by Random.org.

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:49,200
That's its theme song. All right, every recording of this show needs to now be in person because

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,680
that was amazing. Is that its theme song part of the theme song? Yes. All right, so our first player

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,420
- Our first player, and we're going around the table,

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,300
this is delightful for me.

12
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,180
Our first player is a trivia stalwart

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,340
who has had a run of bad luck

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,340
with so many Doctor Who questions.

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,860
I have let him cut the deck

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,580
in hopes that his luck will change.

17
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,980
Welcome, Monty Ashley.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,180
- I'm a stalwart.

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,220
- Our second player appears on, at most,

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,340
one incomparable podcast a year,

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,060
and we are glad it is this one.

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,780
Please welcome Lauren Snell.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,620
- Hi there.

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,700
- Our third player is an author and podcaster

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,640
whose next book, "All Souls Lost"

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,660
is coming out October 17th

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,220
and is available for pre-order now.

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,300
Dan Moran.

29
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,140
- I wish somebody had told me.

30
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,380
Well, now I know, I guess.

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,380
It's so nice to be here as always.

32
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,500
- Our fourth player is appearing

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,220
on his first ever podcast on the Incarnable Network.

34
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,780
(all laughing)

35
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,020
Introducing Jason Snell.

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,020
- Hello, everybody.

37
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,460
I hope I do okay.

38
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,020
- And fifth, but never least,

39
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,380
the host of "Lion's Tower" and "Shields",

40
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,700
it's Shelly Brisbane.

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,120
Will there be questions about lions?

42
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,120
'Cause I expect questions about lions.

43
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,040
- Here's how it works.

44
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,800
Random pursuit is a lot like the classic

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,020
trivial pursuit board game,

46
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,200
but instead of using the board,

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,320
each player has their own six sided die

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,960
or dice rolling app like Dice by P-Calc.

49
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,880
Here we're around a table.

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,980
We have a lot of physical dice.

51
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,040
It's great.

52
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,880
- Sorry, James.

53
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,040
- It's just like P-Calc is last year's news.

54
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,680
- The players roll their die to determine

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,000
which question on the card they will answer.

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
I lost my place.

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
It's going great.

58
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
Do you have an editor?

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
I don't know.

60
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
No, I don't know.

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,040
For each question they answer correctly, they'll get one point.

62
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,920
If they answer correctly, they can roll again for another question, but they can also answer

63
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,760
up to three questions on each turn, except for the final round when there is no question

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
limit.

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
A crazy round.

66
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,360
If they roll the same number two times in a row on the same turn, they get to pick which

67
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,200
edition the question comes from.

68
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
The players usually have a list.

69
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Today they don't.

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,520
Sorry.

71
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,240
It's way too long to read on the podcast.

72
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,680
It's way too long for them to read anyway, so it doesn't matter.

73
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,400
If they happen to roll the same number all three times on the same turn, they can pick

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,080
both the addition and the category.

75
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,720
And sometimes I don't notice this when it happens, so please holler if I miss it.

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,720
We will play for an amount of time determined by me, and then we'll do one last round with

77
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,640
no question limit, and the player with the highest score at the end becomes the random

78
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,160
champion with bragging rights that last until the next time we're all in person together

79
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,320
- At an un-disclosed location.

80
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,080
- Steaks.

81
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,200
- All right, is everybody ready?

82
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,780
- Yes.

83
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,680
- All right, Monty, you get to start us off.

84
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,880
Please roll your D six.

85
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,560
- Three.

86
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,720
- All right, this is coming from, and you cut the deck,

87
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,780
so you have only yourself to blame.

88
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,520
Chex TV trivia.

89
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,360
- Nice.

90
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,880
- Remember, these cards were from 1984.

91
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,680
The third question on the card is,

92
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,620
Yogi Bear first appeared on what cartoon show?

93
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,640
- Wow.

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,320
(all laughing)

95
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,640
That's an interesting question.

96
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,160
I'm going to say the Yogi Bear Show.

97
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,440
- I'm afraid that is not correct.

98
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,280
- Weird.

99
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,280
- Is that Hanna-Barbera hour or something?

100
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,160
- The Huckleberry Hound Show.

101
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,640
- Oh, okay.

102
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,160
- Was there like a backdoor pilot for Yogi Bear?

103
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,000
Yogi Bear?

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
(all laughing)

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,840
- That's a different question.

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,360
- If you see a backdoor pilot,

107
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,560
- I'm not going through it.

108
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,440
(all laughing)

109
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,460
- That's it, Dan's cleaning up his own mistakes.

110
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,300
I love it.

111
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,520
- All right, well, good try, Monty.

112
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,740
Now we're on to Lauren.

113
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,280
Go ahead and roll.

114
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,120
- Five.

115
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,920
- All right, this is coming from the Star Wars

116
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,960
Tribute Pursuit Edition,

117
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,160
in which category five is droids, creatures, and aliens.

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,440
This is a card that has a picture on one side.

119
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,260
And since we're in person,

120
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,560
I can actually show you the picture.

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,600
Usually it's not helpful at all, but here's the picture.

122
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,480
Go ahead and describe that if you can.

123
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,720
Just don't look at the other side of the card

124
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,000
or that would be cheating.

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,360
Maybe, who's that?

126
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,120
- I can't tell the emperor.

127
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,760
- I think it's the emperor and I think he's sitting

128
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,120
by the big round window thing in a throne.

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,960
- Yeah. - All right, well.

130
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,000
- I mean, technically anywhere the emperor sits

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,320
is a throne, I think.

132
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,640
That's how that works, right?

133
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,420
- Let's see if that picture helps you.

134
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,160
Who warned Luke not to underestimate the emperor?

135
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,640
- I think this picture is not helpful.

136
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,120
- That seems not helpful.

137
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,960
Well, I have no memory of that happening,

138
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,120
but let's go with Darth Vader.

139
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,400
It was not Darth Vader.

140
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,240
Anybody else?

141
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,080
- Leia?

142
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,900
- Nope.

143
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,740
- Yoda.

144
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,580
- Yoda.

145
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,400
- Dan has it right, it was Yoda.

146
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,840
- Do not underestimate the powers of the Sith.

147
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,720
- That sounds right.

148
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,040
- Or suffer your father's fate, you will.

149
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,880
- Sorry.

150
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,240
- Will we all be doing impressions?

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,080
- Before he inverts the sentences.

152
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,920
- I'm not prepared.

153
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,920
- He doesn't invert the sentences much in "Jetfire" at all.

154
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,760
- It's true.

155
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,780
And if you watch these,

156
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,200
so it's just like him doing that to mess with Luke.

157
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,040
- Yeah.

158
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,880
And then later it became, he does it every time.

159
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,600
- All right, Dan, that brings us to you.

160
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,560
Will you get another Star Wars question?

161
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,400
- Likely.

162
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,240
- No, you will not.

163
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,760
- A one, please, Erica.

164
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,560
- All right, it said this is coming from the Walt Disney

165
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,680
Family Edition.

166
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,280
This is from the grownups box.

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,120
- Dang it.

168
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,000
- Category, welcome to the world of places.

169
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,080
- I hate places.

170
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,920
- Why are they all in the world?

171
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,760
- They're the worst.

172
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,320
- That's just the world.

173
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,720
- It is.

174
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,760
What, fittingly enough, is the monetary unit of Zaire?

175
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:28,120
- Fittingly enough, it's the monetary unit of Zaire,

176
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,560
a country that I believe is no longer called Zaire, right?

177
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,760
- I don't know, Stephen?

178
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,360
- I cannot divulge that information.

179
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,940
- Is it the Zaire dollar?

180
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,940
- You should have stopped after the word.

181
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,260
- Zire. - Zire, yep.

182
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,100
- I thought about it and I was like, that seems dumb.

183
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,280
- Well.

184
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,380
- All right, well, it was close.

185
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,060
- We are off to a great start in person here.

186
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,060
So far we have a sweep, a sweep of zeros.

187
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,020
So Jason, can you change that for us?

188
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,180
- Seems unlikely, but I'll give it a try.

189
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,360
A one.

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,100
- All right, this is coming from the Doctor Who edition.

191
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,940
I believe this is the 2018 edition

192
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,840
that goes through the first season of Jodie Whittaker.

193
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,760
Category one is Time Lords.

194
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,420
What villain does Clara Oswald follow

195
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,720
into the doctor's own time stream

196
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,080
in his tomb on Trenzalore?

197
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,400
- That is the great intelligence.

198
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,820
- It is, we have our first point.

199
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,660
- Score.

200
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,620
- As played by our good friend,

201
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,260
oh, what's his name?

202
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,980
You got this.

203
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,460
- No points. - It's not for any points.

204
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,060
- But it's a, it's a, it's a, no, it's not.

205
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,220
- He's iconic.

206
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,620
- I know, but now I can't remember his name.

207
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,860
- He was in "Loki", he was in "Star Wars"

208
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,700
later after this. - I know.

209
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,420
- Richard E. Grant. - There we go.

210
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,140
- Richard E. Grant as the great intelligence.

211
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,300
- Oh, from "Husky Hawk".

212
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,860
- He had another dumb name,

213
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,620
but he was revealed to be the great intelligence.

214
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,460
Okay.

215
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,060
Six.

216
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,660
- All right, this is coming from the totally 80s edition.

217
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,980
And I realized looking at the boxes on my shelf

218
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,020
the other day that the Totally 80s Edition

219
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,260
is yet another only sold in Canada version

220
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,620
that has, I think, 500 questions, specifically Canadian.

221
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,460
Let's see if this is one of them.

222
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,060
- Only Canada experienced the 80s.

223
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,660
- Category six is wildcard.

224
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,660
So what Screech Owl author co-wrote the 1989 book

225
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,100
Home Game, colon, Hockey and Life in Canada?

226
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,940
Screech Owl is italicized.

227
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,500
- I think Steve is about to have a seizure.

228
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,620
- Home game hockey in life in Canada is also italicized.

229
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm guessing this is one of the 500 Canadian questions.

230
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,020
- Could it be a Canadian hockey player?

231
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,860
I'm just kidding.

232
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,020
(laughing)

233
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,820
- Well, we know it's the author of Screech Owl.

234
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,960
- And that's why it's clearly TV screech Dustin Diamond.

235
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,580
(laughing)

236
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,900
- That was also my first thought.

237
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,360
- Twist. - I admit it.

238
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,420
No, that is not correct.

239
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
Steven, did you know this one?

240
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,900
- No, no, I didn't know.

241
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,280
- Wait, what?

242
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,120
- Yeah.

243
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,940
- Somebody named Roy MacGregor?

244
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,940
I know, I know Aurora McGregor.

245
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,300
But I don't, I didn't know that book.

246
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
I think I misheard the question and thought it was something else.

247
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Is that like Conor McGregor's grandpa or something?

248
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,740
Uh, yes.

249
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,420
Isn't that the fighter, the MMA fighter?

250
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,300
Is that what we're talking about?

251
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,020
Yeah, I don't know.

252
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,500
Okay.

253
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,180
Mr. McGregor's, uh, Peter Rabbit's, uh, grandson?

254
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,140
That's right.

255
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,180
I'm not speaking about hockey players.

256
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,900
Did you say Mr. McGregor is Peter Rabbit's grandson?

257
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,860
No, because that's a twist on a good movie.

258
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,540
How do you feel about Skeletor and He-Man?

259
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,120
- And my bookmarks.

260
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,060
- Somehow my bookmarks on my document are gone.

261
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,100
So I can't scroll down easily.

262
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,260
- Dan, Skeletor is his enemy.

263
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,140
- And his uncle.

264
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,980
- Yeah, and his uncle.

265
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,800
- Real twisty.

266
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,820
- There's no such thing as a Skeletor free podcast.

267
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,940
- It's true. It's true.

268
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,780
All right. Well, we have one point on the board.

269
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,620
Shelly, can you get us another one?

270
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,300
- I don't know, Erica.

271
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,240
We'll find out.

272
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,500
I got a two.

273
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,340
- All right.

274
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,440
This is coming from the 2000s edition

275
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,080
in which the cards are all different colors.

276
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,960
Each color indicates a category.

277
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,000
This is the pinkish, purplish one.

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,280
I don't know what that means,

279
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,040
and I couldn't scroll down to it fast enough.

280
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,920
This is harder than I thought it was gonna be.

281
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,520
One second here while I find it.

282
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,400
Because knowing the category will make a huge difference

283
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,600
in whether I get it right.

284
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,200
- My second category was,

285
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,640
we gave up and there aren't any categories anymore.

286
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,720
I just wanna point out.

287
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,680
- That's true.

288
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,120
This is entertainment, it's a pink card.

289
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,960
- That makes sense.

290
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,520
- You also have a subcategory.

291
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,080
The subcategory of the card is short and sweet.

292
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,760
So keep that in mind as you answer this question.

293
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,780
- Okay.

294
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,280
- What quick-witted son of Christie

295
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,280
on the TV series "Mom" is played by Blake Garrett Rosenthal?

296
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,160
Mom is in italics.

297
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,480
Christie is spelled C-H-R-I-S-T-Y.

298
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,980
- I don't know any of those words you spoke to me.

299
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,680
We want the character, not the act,

300
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,520
you've told me the actor, so we want the character.

301
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,740
- Yeah, well, yes, the character's name.

302
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,140
And you'll need the first name.

303
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,100
- Oh, well, that makes it so much easier.

304
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,140
- Do you know any first names, Shelley?

305
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,800
Just start naming them.

306
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,620
- I should say Dan just for that, but I will not.

307
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,440
I'm gonna say Elliot.

308
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,600
That seems like a good TV character name.

309
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,440
I don't know.

310
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,740
- No, somebody named Roscoe.

311
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,420
- Roscoe is also a good TV character.

312
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,660
- Yes, I agree.

313
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,780
All right.

314
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,600
- After the first round, Jason has won.

315
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,540
(all laughing)

316
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,620
- Not won the game.

317
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,260
(all laughing)

318
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,060
- Never, never.

319
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,440
Steven determines.

320
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,280
- Yeah.

321
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,820
- I mean, if nobody scores any points

322
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,820
for the rest of the game, then technically, yes.

323
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,220
- That is how it will work.

324
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,420
No, it is back around to Monty.

325
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,260
- We played for hours,

326
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,260
but Jason actually won after 10 minutes.

327
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,780
- I rolled a two.

328
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,860
- All right, this is coming

329
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,460
from the Walt Disney Family Edition.

330
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
It is from the Grown-Us box.

331
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,460
Category two is, "Monty, welcome to the world of music."

332
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,140
It's one of the better worlds.

333
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,700
What key is "We Are The World" written in?

334
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,940
(laughing)

335
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,780
- Wow.

336
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,260
(laughing)

337
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,940
♪ There is a time ♪

338
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,900
- Yeah.

339
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,180
♪ When we must heed a certain call ♪

340
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,580
♪ And the world must come together as one ♪

341
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,900
- Where are my harmonies?

342
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,900
- And now I must stop this for copyright reasons.

343
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,060
We should no longer sing the rest of "We Are The World."

344
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,700
- All right, I'm gonna say G major.

345
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,540
- That is not it.

346
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,540
Steven, you have perfect pitch, do you know this?

347
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,540
I'm gonna hum it in my head and then guess.

348
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,540
(humming)

349
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,540
C major was my guess.

350
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,540
This, everybody, is your scorekeeper, humming.

351
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,540
We are the world.

352
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,540
That's the lamest key.

353
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,540
It's the best key, it's E.

354
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,540
E?

355
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,540
It just says E, not E major or E minor?

356
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,540
I object.

357
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,540
Your objection is noted.

358
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,540
To the record, an overrule.

359
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,540
Welcome back to Random Pursuit, Monty.

360
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,840
(all laughing)

361
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,380
- All right, Lauren, which roll to four?

362
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,760
- All right, this is coming from the 1980s edition.

363
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,640
Yes, it's only shiny on one side of the card,

364
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,140
but I'm not showing you the card right now because--

365
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,980
- They saved money on that.

366
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,140
- Yes. - There was a whole

367
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,760
coding process they didn't have to do.

368
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,080
- Not the totally 80s edition, just the regular 80s edition?

369
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,920
- Just the regular bad 80s edition.

370
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,240
- But more importantly, the quality and style of the card

371
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,320
has come up and that's an important aspect

372
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,160
of random pursuit. - Yeah, I'm always here

373
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,000
for card talk by Erica,

374
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,820
editorializing about production guys.

375
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,780
- After my experience with the good edition of the 80s,

376
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,460
I am skeptical.

377
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,060
- All right, well, category four is TL,

378
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,820
which I think stands for timeline.

379
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,540
- Or time.

380
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,360
- Usually I have all of these in front of me.

381
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,200
- Too long.

382
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,020
- Timeline?

383
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,860
- Timeline?

384
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,700
- I could be wrong.

385
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,780
- A category called timeline?

386
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,220
- It's just history with another name.

387
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,060
- No, I was wrong.

388
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,140
- You met a decade-

389
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,980
- It's the world.

390
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,060
- Welcome to the world of times.

391
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,900
- Ooh.

392
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,340
- No, I had it mixed up with lives and times,

393
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,140
which is a totally different game, a different edition.

394
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,420
- No, it stands for total lines.

395
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,540
- This is so much better.

396
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,580
The TL stands for that's life.

397
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,580
(all laughing)

398
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,300
So please enjoy your question about life, I guess.

399
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,540
What does the I stand for

400
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,540
in Minolta's smart Maxome 7000i camera?

401
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,940
And they're asking about the I, it's a lowercase I,

402
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,920
and Maxome is spelled M-A-X-X-U-M.

403
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,660
It's italicized, and then there's the 7000,

404
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,100
seven, zero, zero, zero, and a lowercase I.

405
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,580
So what does that I stand for

406
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,340
in Minolta's smart Maxim 7000i camera?

407
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:31,420
The only thing I can think of is ISO,

408
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,260
but presumably that's its own acronym.

409
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,700
So that's probably not right.

410
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:44,180
Intelligent.

411
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,020
- It's a good guess.

412
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,820
- I'm gonna give it to you 'cause it's intelligence.

413
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,220
- Oh, hooray! - Good job.

414
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,820
- The snells are on the board, the rest of us suck.

415
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,740
That's right, so you get to roll again.

416
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,060
$7,000, too much for our cameras.

417
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,980
But it sees so well.

418
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,440
It's a biblically accurate camera.

419
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,340
I rolled a one.

420
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,140
All right.

421
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,700
This is coming from the 20th anniversary edition, no longer

422
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,300
my least favorite edition.

423
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,140
Category one is global view.

424
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,620
Did it get better?

425
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,120
No.

426
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,500
Something worse arrived.

427
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,540
Publish the rankings.

428
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,460
Ooh, that would be fun.

429
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,140
Global view is your category.

430
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,380
What California city was described by columnist Jim

431
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,980
Murray as quote, under policed and over sexed.

432
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,780
- So many.

433
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,460
- California, does that narrow it down?

434
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,140
- San Francisco?

435
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,320
- It's not.

436
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,160
- Los Angeles?

437
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,980
- It is Los Angeles.

438
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,660
- Jim Murray was a sports columnist at the LA Times.

439
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,980
- Oh, he was, that's right.

440
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,820
- I would have guessed San Francisco.

441
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,500
- You had background information that I did not have.

442
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,340
- I would have guessed Oakland.

443
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,160
- People like insulting Oakland.

444
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,000
- Yes, they do.

445
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,820
- That's true.

446
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,660
- There's no there there.

447
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,500
- But you got on the board, so those are good terms.

448
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,100
- I got on the board, that was my goal

449
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,900
for this entire game.

450
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,740
- Lauren has won.

451
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,320
(all laughing)

452
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,580
- Five, please, Erika.

453
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,060
- All right, this is coming from

454
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,900
the Trivial Pursuit Millennium Edition.

455
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,560
Remember, not millennial, millennium.

456
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,180
Category five is sports and leisure.

457
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,220
- Move on.

458
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,300
- Who became the first NFL quarterback

459
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,320
to pass for 50,000 career yards in 1996?

460
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,600
-Steven's posture just changed.

461
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,720
I feel like he knows this one.

462
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,280
-In 1996, I could name some quarterbacks.

463
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,440
I don't know if I, yeah.

464
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,320
I'm just going to go with the one that is the one that I obviously

465
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
sometimes get mistaken for, Dan Marino.

466
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,800
-You got it.

467
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
-It's Dan Marino.

468
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,400
-It is totally Dan Marino.

469
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,920
Good job.

470
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,880
-Wow.

471
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,560
-When I try to search sometimes, it's like, "Did you mean Dan Marino?"

472
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,000
There you go.

473
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,360
I wrote a one please.

474
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,800
All right, this is coming from genus three.

475
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Category one is people in places.

476
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,900
How old was Drew Barrymore when she began drinking?

477
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,240
You were there, you remember?

478
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,160
Yeah, I remember back at a party, me and Drew.

479
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,360
I feel really uncomfortable.

480
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,720
I'm guessing that answer is way younger than it should be.

481
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,360
How young, how young is too young?

482
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,940
How young is disturbingly young?

483
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,000
Let's say nine.

484
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,840
- You were so close.

485
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,960
- Is it 10?

486
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,800
- It was eight.

487
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,020
- Oh, I was at seven and then I went off.

488
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,720
I think it was on the set of "Firestarter."

489
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,800
- Wow.

490
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,640
- Dang, Joe.

491
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,460
- So picture her there.

492
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,600
(all laughing)

493
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,800
- All right, well, you're on the board.

494
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
You're on the board, yes, congratulations.

495
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,540
- Dan Morin has won.

496
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,720
(all laughing)

497
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,800
- All right, go ahead, Jason.

498
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,840
- I'm so used to being told to play,

499
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,200
but we are all just in order here.

500
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,680
- Actually, it's actually Czechs trivia time.

501
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,880
I just realized I forgot to make Monty roll a D8

502
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,320
the first time, but now we're taking advantage

503
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,040
of all eight questions on the card.

504
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,880
- Number four.

505
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,700
- All right.

506
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,540
- So not really.

507
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,360
(laughing)

508
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,200
- No.

509
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,840
All right, this is from Czechs music trivia.

510
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,240
The fourth question is,

511
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,240
what well-known slogan was associated with Sammy K?

512
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,800
That's K-A-Y-E, Sammy K.

513
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,960
It's a well-known slogan, Jason.

514
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,720
- I can't believe you don't know this.

515
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Sammy K. I mean, who among us remembers Sammy K?

516
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,020
- Nobody's raising their hands.

517
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,860
- Nope.

518
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,400
- I'm gonna say,

519
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,320
Rock Around the Clock.

520
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,960
- I mean, you're coming to the right neighborhood.

521
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,560
It's a swing and sway with Sammy K.

522
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,400
- Of course it is.

523
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,220
- Tip of my tongue.

524
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,400
- Big, big band guys.

525
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,240
So a little before Rock Around the Clock.

526
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,080
- Ah, big band.

527
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,900
- Oh, okay.

528
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,960
All right, Shelly, it is now your turn.

529
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,220
- I still have one.

530
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,620
You got it.

531
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,460
- Yeah, Jason still has one.

532
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,280
- No.

533
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,120
- Five.

534
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,960
- All right, a five for Shelly.

535
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,140
- I should tell the microphones, hello, I'm alive.

536
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,500
- All right, this is coming from the DVD

537
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,820
Pop Culture Edition.

538
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,780
Category five is Buzz.

539
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,700
Whatever.

540
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,540
- It's about bees, it's all about bees.

541
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,700
- It's all about bees.

542
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,180
- What member of the British Royal Family

543
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,620
is the author of the Budgie the, sorry,

544
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,100
of the "Budgie the Little Helicopter" children's books.

545
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,640
It's a whole series apparently.

546
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,420
So we need a member of the British royal family.

547
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,540
- I know about them.

548
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,420
British royal family.

549
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,220
I'm just gonna guess princess somebody.

550
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,100
No, I'm gonna guess princess Anne.

551
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,980
- It was Sarah Ferguson.

552
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,820
- Oh, Fergie.

553
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,660
- That was my guess.

554
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,940
I was like, please don't let it be Prince Andrew.

555
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,180
(all laughing)

556
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,020
Real bad.

557
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,840
- Luckily it was not.

558
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,900
All right, Stephen, how do we stand?

559
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,500
- Some of you have won.

560
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,660
The rest of you have not.

561
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,860
(all laughing)

562
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,380
- That into the table has won.

563
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,700
- All right, yeah, the people who are closer to me have not.

564
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,300
I feel a little sad for them.

565
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,700
All right, Monty, what'd you roll?

566
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
- I rolled a five.

567
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,100
- All right, this is coming from Trivial Pursuit,

568
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,300
Genus 4, category 5 is sports and leisure.

569
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,060
What golfer bid a tearful farewell to fans

570
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,800
after playing his last US Open in 1994?

571
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,900
- Lee Trevino.

572
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,820
- It was not, it was Arnold Palmer.

573
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,720
- All right, well, that means I was,

574
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,180
Link Trovino probably stopped around then.

575
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,100
They were contemporaries.

576
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,800
- I have no idea about any of these things.

577
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,240
So sure, yeah, good job.

578
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,440
- I rolled a three.

579
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,340
- All right, ooh, this is coming from the Decades edition,

580
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,440
which I think is my newest edition,

581
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,540
which has no even letters on here

582
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,640
to tell me what these categories might be.

583
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,800
So this is dropping in my rankings.

584
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,760
I will tell you that right now.

585
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,040
Category three is news alert.

586
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,880
- Gosh.

587
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,700
- Yeah.

588
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,540
(mimics alarm)

589
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,680
- Not to be confused with fuzz.

590
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,880
- That's life.

591
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,200
- What island country was the starting point

592
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,760
for Diana Nyad's historic 103 mile swim,

593
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,160
which ended on the shores of Key West in 2013?

594
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,500
How far?

595
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,640
Island country, and it was 103 miles.

596
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,660
So 103 miles away from Key West, you will find.

597
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,880
Okay, Cuba's not that far.

598
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Cuba's only like 26 miles from Florida,

599
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,760
but that's literally all the geography

600
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,200
I know about that region.

601
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,160
What's further than that?

602
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,160
I have Island Nation, the island, the country?

603
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,800
- Yeah, you were looking for the island country.

604
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,700
- Oh, both. - That's the way it says.

605
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,480
- Bahamas.

606
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,040
- It is actually Cuba.

607
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,880
- Cuba.

608
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,720
- It is not.

609
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,680
- Key West is very far from Florida.

610
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,800
- Yeah, I think Key West must be so far south.

611
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,120
- They always say Cuba is 90 miles from Florida,

612
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,900
Key West is further.

613
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,240
- Yes, and apparently this is one of the newer cards

614
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,160
that tells you a little extra information.

615
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,200
It took her 53 hours.

616
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,440
- Okay.

617
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,960
- It's Catalina that is 26 miles from LA.

618
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,600
Cuba is 90 miles from Florida.

619
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,720
- For those that remember their Cuban Missile Crisis trivia.

620
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,240
And for those of us who've been to Cuba,

621
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,760
I imagine I'm the only one who is allowed to go at this table. So yeah.

622
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh, you now, welcome to Cuba.

623
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,400
They might not let her back in.

624
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
That is not the undisclosed location.

625
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,720
And yeah, if she went to Cuba, the US might not let her back in.

626
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,200
That's true.

627
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,000
Yep.

628
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
All right. Next is Dan.

629
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,520
Three, please.

630
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,680
All right. This is coming from the Doctor Who edition.

631
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,320
This is the 2018 edition that goes all the way through one season of Jodie Whittaker.

632
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,960
Category episodes and stories.

633
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,840
In the story, the empty child, what spooky phrase did the child and the gas mask repeat over and over?

634
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,800
Are you my mommy?

635
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,080
That one I knew.

636
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,480
You got it. And everybody got to watch me turn the card the correct way, upright,

637
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,040
and then have to flip it over because it goes side to side.

638
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,000
I appreciate that you even check the answers on the Doctor Who card.

639
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,400
I mean, sometimes they're wrong.

640
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,160
Right. You have to get the wrong answer though.

641
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,760
Let's hope that doesn't happen. I don't want to have to think that hard about it.

642
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,720
it is. That's a three. What category was that? That was also a three so you get to choose your edition.

643
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:16,120
Hot dog. Let's go start. I don't have a hot dog edition. Hot dog the movie edition. But I do have Star Wars. Oh and guess what?

644
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,400
It's another one with a picture on the back. I'm gonna pass this around. Keep your

645
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,600
face down. Yes. No cheating. I'm watching you. I'm not cheating. Tell us what the picture is.

646
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,800
- This is a picture of Coruscant, I believe,

647
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,200
at the end of Return of the Jedi.

648
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,040
It's one of the--

649
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,880
- Special edition. - Special edition.

650
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,040
- Thank you for the clarification.

651
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,920
- Yes. - Yes.

652
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,760
I mean, this edition did come with a very small package

653
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,920
of cards that are about the prequels.

654
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,080
- I had that edition, yeah.

655
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,280
- Those are not included in my deck.

656
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,200
Maybe I will add them,

657
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,640
but right now they're just like underneath the thing.

658
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,240
- If you need more cards, you know.

659
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,120
- Right, I'm running so low.

660
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,000
All right, category three is history.

661
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,360
Remember, this is the history of the Star Wars world,

662
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,380
not ours.

663
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,140
- You say that like they're different things.

664
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,960
You say that like he knows our world's history

665
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,800
better than Star Wars.

666
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,640
(laughing)

667
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,840
- Touche.

668
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,280
What do people pass over their heads

669
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,360
at the end of Return of the Jedi Special Edition?

670
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,280
What do people pass over their heads

671
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,640
at the end of Return of the Jedi Special Edition?

672
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,000
- What do they pass over their heads?

673
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,480
- Weird question.

674
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,360
- I have a thought and I'm trying to figure out

675
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
how to write the right way to phrase it.

676
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,720
Pass over their head.

677
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,360
What do they, sorry, can we read one more time?

678
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,340
- Sure.

679
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,720
What do people pass over their heads

680
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,240
at the end of "Return of the Jedi" special edition?

681
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,360
"Return of the Jedi" special edition is italicized.

682
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,920
I don't know if that helps. - Thank you, I appreciate that.

683
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Is it a fallen, like parts of a statue of the emperor?

684
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
- It is not.

685
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,280
It's a stormtrooper.

686
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,420
- Oh. - Even darker.

687
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,140
- Man, I have not watched the special edition

688
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,100
of any game quite some time.

689
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,140
- The latest special edition passes the guy

690
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,640
who sings "Jedi Rocks" over there.

691
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,820
- Is he singing at the time?

692
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,820
- No, he is dead.

693
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,540
(all laughing)

694
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,380
- Makes it extra special.

695
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,020
- As is right and proper.

696
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,020
All right, Jason.

697
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,860
- Four.

698
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,220
- All right, it's coming from Genus3.

699
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,460
Category four is science and nature.

700
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,140
What does the government label, sorry,

701
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,100
what does the government label you

702
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,380
if you have 10% or less of normal vision?

703
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:26,140
- Legally blind? - That's it. Roll again.

704
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,820
- As someone who is legally blind, I have never heard that defined in that way, ever.

705
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:36,220
- It contains less than 10% of the time.

706
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,260
- Four. - All right. That's another four. So you get

707
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,260
to choose. - Was it?

708
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,260
- Yeah. - Oh.

709
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:48,780
- Yep. That was a... Wait. You did roll four last time, correct? Or did I read the wrong

710
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,780
- I don't remember. - I don't remember either.

711
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
- Then yeah, choose your edition.

712
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,780
- Check the audio.

713
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
- Disney Kids.

714
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,780
- All right.

715
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,780
- I'm here to win.

716
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,780
- Yeah, just question it.

717
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
- Oops.

718
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,780
The Baby Boomer and the Disney Kids questions

719
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,780
have the same color in the background of the card.

720
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,780
- I'm sure you can detect which is which.

721
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,780
- And I, yeah, I think you would probably be very unhappy

722
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,780
if I picked the wrong one.

723
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
- We had the Baby Boomer edition at home

724
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,780
and the Silver Screen.

725
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,780
They're both very difficult and I don't like them.

726
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,780
- Jason, welcome to the world of fantasy.

727
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
- Okay, all right.

728
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,780
- My favorite of the worlds.

729
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
What does the cat do?

730
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,780
- I don't know.

731
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,780
- I don't know.

732
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,580
and they're both very difficult and I don't like them.

733
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,860
- Jason, welcome to the world of fantasy.

734
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,700
- Okay, hooray.

735
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,820
- My favorite of the worlds.

736
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,580
What does the caterpillar in "Alice in Wonderland"

737
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,360
sit on, a mushroom or a toadstool?

738
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,660
(all laughing)

739
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,500
- Harder than you thought.

740
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,140
- Okay, okay.

741
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,940
- For a children's- - Respect.

742
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,440
- Multiple choice with only two choices question,

743
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,020
this is actually hard.

744
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,180
I'm going to say toadstool.

745
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,020
- It's a mushroom.

746
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,660
(all laughing)

747
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,620
- I like that Jason and I both got you pick cards

748
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,060
and things we've never really seen.

749
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,220
- I know, that makes it hurt all the more.

750
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,660
- Totes still seem more fantastic.

751
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,500
- I agree.

752
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,580
- I have rolled a three.

753
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,780
- All right, well, this is also coming

754
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,660
from the Disney edition kids box

755
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,740
because that's what was next.

756
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,740
- Mushroom.

757
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,540
- So category three, welcome to the world of people,

758
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,980
possibly the worst of all the world.

759
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,220
(all laughing)

760
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,060
- I agree.

761
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,140
- Publish the rankings.

762
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,060
- Who's running with a speeding ticket

763
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,000
inspired the Mickey Mouse cartoon Traffic Troubles?

764
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,520
- Wait, read that again, please.

765
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,740
- Who's run-in with a speeding ticket

766
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,660
inspired the Mickey Mouse cartoon Traffic Troubles?

767
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,140
- They like ran into the speeding ticket?

768
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,300
- No, run in with, I guess.

769
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,220
Run in.

770
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,660
- They like to make these questions

771
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,440
sort of artful in their phrasing,

772
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,940
but I think it boils down to who got a speeding ticket

773
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,420
and then wrote this cartoon.

774
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,500
- Okay, so Mickey Mouse.

775
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,800
So clearly Disney, not Warner Brothers

776
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,860
that I had in my head for a second there.

777
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,300
traffic troubles.

778
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,880
I don't know, Minnie Mouse.

779
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,740
- I think you were off the track a little bit there.

780
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,200
The answer is actually Walt Disney.

781
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
- Oh, I see.

782
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,800
And that was one of the different editions

784
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,680
have different like good basic answers.

785
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,880
If it's the Walt Disney edition

786
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,960
and it's a Disney question and it's a real person,

787
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,440
it's just Walt Disney.

788
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,720
- You did say world of people.

789
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm a mountain listing comprehension

790
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,240
is not doing well today.

791
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,320
- All right, after three rounds, goodness me,

792
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,360
Dan and Jason have actual scores of two.

793
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,720
Lauren has one point and Shelley and Monty

794
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,880
still looking to get on the board.

795
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,800
- All right, Monty, this might be your time

796
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,160
because it's junior trivia.

797
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,000
- I'm rolling a die supposedly made from a Civil War bullet.

798
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,520
- Wow.

799
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,400
- It is a one.

800
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,440
- All right, well, it would be cool

801
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,520
if this was a Civil War question, but it's not.

802
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
This is coming from junior trivia two.

803
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,760
So think like a 10 to 13 year old from 1983 or four,

804
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,800
somewhere in there.

805
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,640
- Poop.

806
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
(laughing)

807
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,480
Nailed it.

808
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,920
- You're on a good start there.

809
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,320
Who is the Duke of Edinburgh married to?

810
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,680
The Duke of Edinburgh married to?

811
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,160
- Duke of Edinburgh.

812
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,000
- Burra, yes.

813
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,920
- In 1984?

814
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,760
- Yep.

815
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,960
- Lady Diana Spencer?

816
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,800
- No.

817
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,640
- The Queen!

818
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,440
- Queen Elizabeth II.

819
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,040
I cannot be bothered to care about the royals at all

820
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,400
in any respect.

821
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,640
- That's why we let you play with us.

822
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,000
- I salute you for that.

823
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,760
All right, Lauren.

824
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,720
- I rolled a one.

825
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,520
- All right, this is coming from the 90s edition.

826
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,960
Your question is coming from 1994.

827
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,560
The cards specify the year.

828
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,080
So category one is oops.

829
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,920
Oh dear.

830
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
- That's life.

831
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,760
- Yep.

832
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,040
- Welcome to the world of people.

833
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,640
- What US state's lucky voters got to pull the lever

834
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,260
For Howard Stern for governor.

835
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,100
- Oh.

836
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,520
- What US states, lucky voters,

837
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,800
got to pull the lever for Howard Stern for governor.

838
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,360
I feel like this is editorializing in a weird way.

839
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,400
Did we have a recall election in '94?

840
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,240
New York.

841
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,080
It is New York.

842
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,040
- Oh, roll again.

843
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,200
- Yeah, he's very New York.

844
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,800
- Yes, if that was a Jeopardy question,

845
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,320
- See the way my mind works-- - Lucky would mean something

846
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,720
and you'd have to guess Nevada or New Jersey maybe,

847
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,560
but it's not, it's just trivia per se.

848
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,760
- The way my mind works, I wonder whether

849
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,200
they were actually using lepers in 1994.

850
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,080
- One, I believe again.

851
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,920
- Yes. - I think they were

852
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,840
in New York. - What edition

853
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,680
would you like your question to come from?

854
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,360
- Something easy.

855
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,800
- Well, you know, junior trivia,

856
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,860
one or two are popular choices.

857
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,600
The Disney Kids box is popular,

858
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,440
although that didn't-- - Disney Kids.

859
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,720
- Okay. - Great, let's do it.

860
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,400
- And this time I know just where to find them.

861
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,520
All right, category one, Welcome to the World of Places.

862
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,460
- Yay, we're old. - Love places.

863
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,340
- All right. - I hate them so much.

864
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,720
- Our visitors allowed to walk up the Washington Monument.

865
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,560
Yes.

866
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,800
- No.

867
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,280
- You have to take the elevator.

868
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,120
- No, they do that in.

869
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,840
- You go down, but you have to take the elevator.

870
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,720
- Oh, I've never done that.

871
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,600
I was just thinking about the "Spider-Man" movie

872
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,280
where she doesn't wanna go up.

873
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,480
- Yeah, they might, they might.

874
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,100
I don't think so, 'cause there's only one staircase,

875
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,940
I think is the problem.

876
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,780
Everybody's going down.

877
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,600
- I didn't do it. - Well, that's a world

878
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,760
of places for you.

879
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,600
- Yeah, no.

880
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,720
- Oh, well, I chose poorly.

881
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,920
- It's a rough world.

882
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,400
- Well, all of our special roles have led to failure now.

883
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,240
- That's true.

884
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,060
- This is unusual.

885
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,600
- I also had a 50/50 chance.

886
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,680
- Yes, yeah.

887
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,840
- Well done.

888
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,760
- Five, please.

889
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,640
- All right, this is coming from Junior Trivia One.

890
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,680
- I'll probably botch it.

891
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,300
- All right, number five.

892
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,240
Where is Mount St. Helens volcano?

893
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,860
Where is it?

894
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,480
Remember, five to nine year old.

895
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,560
- We will need the exact longitude

896
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,900
and latitude coordinates for this, by the way.

897
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,560
- Oregon?

898
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,660
- It's Montana.

899
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,640
- No. - Washington.

900
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,480
- It's Washington.

901
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,600
- Okay, I'm told you can see it, right?

902
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,440
- Yeah.

903
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,000
- We're very high from Seattle.

904
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,360
- The river up here is literally,

905
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,640
well, I mean, undisclosed location.

906
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,480
It's very close to where we are.

907
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,600
- We're recording from Mount St. Helens.

908
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,080
- On a plane ride I recently took,

909
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,400
there were people looking out my adjacent window,

910
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,120
pointing and going, "That's Mount St. Helens."

911
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,160
No, it's something else.

912
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,200
There was a lot of argument.

913
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,480
- I was told I could see it,

914
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,200
and the answer is I did not realize there was a line.

915
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,640
- State borders are very tricky.

916
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,680
The card specifically says, "The state of Washington, USA."

917
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,040
- Yeah, I was gonna say,

918
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,140
would the United States have been a good enough answer there?

919
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,040
Six.

920
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,600
- All right, Jason, this is coming from the family edition.

921
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,440
- Right. - Yes.

922
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,800
But this is the, let's see,

923
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,280
the yellow cards are the children's cards.

924
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,820
- Yay, I am doomed.

925
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,720
- What was the number again?

926
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,640
- Six. - Six, all right.

927
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,800
Six, wild card.

928
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,700
- Not a category.

929
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,680
- Welcome to the world of wild cards.

930
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,920
- What bird's holes did one time

931
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,680
Arizona Lieutenant Governor Ernest Hall

932
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,880
collect thousands of as a hobby?

933
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,020
What bird's holes?

934
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,160
- I'm gonna say the woodpecker.

935
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,000
- Yes.

936
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,800
- Any other answer is incredibly disturbing.

937
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,800
- Cloaca would have been my second guess.

938
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,600
- Yes, but which bird's cloacas?

939
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,400
- All right, number six was my last roll,

940
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,640
so now we all remember that.

941
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,480
And it's a one.

942
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,440
- All right, this is coming from the Friends edition,

943
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,320
where the one, category one is at the bottom of the card,

944
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,440
where we have seasons one and two.

945
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,280
- Oh, excellent.

946
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,560
- Yeah, the Friends edition just makes me so mad.

947
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,160
Why would you put seasons one and two

948
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,280
at the bottom of the card?

949
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,560
Who does that?

950
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,960
Anyway, executive decision.

951
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,400
- Could it be any more annoying?

952
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,960
- No.

953
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,120
Also well played, reference acknowledged.

954
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,680
seasons one and two, where does the gang find

955
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,520
Rachel's lost wedding ring?

956
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:36,680
- Oh man, it hurts more when you know you did know this

957
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,860
and you don't know it anymore.

958
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:46,480
Rachel's lost wedding ring, 'cause she was in the pilot,

959
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,520
she's fleeing a marriage, is that right, I think?

960
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,000
- I'm not gonna answer that question

961
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,840
in part 'cause I don't remember.

962
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,080
- I think that's how that show starts.

963
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,760
They find it in

964
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,080
Marcel the monkey.

965
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,200
(laughing)

966
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,680
- Not it.

967
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,880
It's in Monica's lasagna.

968
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,760
- Okay.

969
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,400
- Which makes about as much sense.

970
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,640
- They found that the lasagna was later found

971
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,720
in Marcel the monkey.

972
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,820
- Which was inside a raw turkey.

973
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,660
- All right, Shelly.

974
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,480
- That's horrifying.

975
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,320
I rolled a one.

976
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,880
- All right, this is coming from the 1980s edition.

977
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,720
The janky old.

978
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:30,560
old 1980s edition. "Personalities" I think is the is the category. What ill-fated

979
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,160
Democratic presidential hopeful said of himself? "He educated the people."

980
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:45,760
Okay this is a topic with which I am somewhat familiar. The answer however, Democratic

981
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,440
presidential hopeful in a edition that was released it's about the 80s it's

982
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,660
about the 80s yes I'm sorry repeat the quote to me again please sure he

983
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,260
educated the people yes well that clarifies it doesn't it yeah so this is

984
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,020
about the 80s you know that's what I said about my favorite teacher in high

985
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,340
school he educated the people welcome to the world I'm just gonna go with Walter

986
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,220
and people it was not it was Duke caucus nope Gary Hart it was Gary Hart

987
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,960
- That is not the Gary Hart quote I would have thought.

988
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,800
(laughing)

989
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,880
- He educated the people about what not to do

990
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,640
as a candidate for sure.

991
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,940
- All right, that's the end of four rounds, kids.

992
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,620
Jason and Dan tied at the top of three.

993
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,520
Lauren was two, Shelly was none,

994
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,580
and Monty hoping to get yet another question,

995
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,500
but the Royal Family also was none.

996
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,740
(laughing)

997
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,180
- I have rolled a five.

998
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,900
- All right, this is coming from the Baby Boomer edition.

999
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,740
Category five is lives and times,

1000
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,780
which is what I was confused about earlier.

1001
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,300
What couple named their first born child Chastity?

1002
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,860
- Sonny and Cher.

1003
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,060
- Correct, do you know their last name?

1004
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,860
- Sonny Bono and Sherilyn Sarkeesian.

1005
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,620
- Oh wow, wow.

1006
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,740
- Bonus ghost point for Monty,

1007
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,940
the card says Sonny and Cher Bono.

1008
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,460
- Chastity is now Chas.

1009
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,300
- That's right.

1010
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,260
- Now I have rolled a three.

1011
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,460
- All right, this is coming from the DVD

1012
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:15,280
pop culture edition category three is music under what name did 60s musical

1013
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:22,660
eccentric Don van Vliet record V-L-I-E-T under what name did 60s

1014
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:29,100
musical eccentric Don van Vliet record? Captain Beefheart. You got it!

1015
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:36,300
Big influence on Frank Zappa real weirdo check him out.

1016
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,140
- All right.

1017
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,340
- Monty is zooming.

1018
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,700
I rolled another three.

1019
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,940
- Oh, what edition would you like your question

1020
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,780
to come from?

1021
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,260
- Genus one, please.

1022
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,420
- I thought so.

1023
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,180
- The edition Monty has memorized.

1024
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,500
- All right, and that was a one, no three, three.

1025
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,820
Okay, so history.

1026
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,380
Who discovered Victoria Falls?

1027
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,300
- Ooh, interesting.

1028
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,100
- And colonial.

1029
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,500
- Yeah, I was gonna say an asterisk on that one.

1030
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,340
- Definitely.

1031
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,160
- Yes.

1032
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,220
was in, oh boy, I don't know my explorers as much as I should,

1033
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,500
nor my geography, so this could be wildly wrong.

1034
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,740
Livingstone?

1035
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,740
- Yes, indeed. - That's gonna be my guess.

1036
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,580
- Do you know his first name?

1037
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,860
It's not required. - I don't.

1038
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,180
- It's David.

1039
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,180
- Oh.

1040
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,420
- No, Stanley's the one who meets him.

1041
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,820
- Right. - Oh, Stanley meets Livingstone.

1042
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,100
That's right, Dr. Livingstone, I presume,

1043
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,700
said Mr. Stanley, who does not have a doctorate

1044
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,780
in fighting people. - That was a sweep.

1045
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,620
Congratulations.

1046
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,580
- Well done, Monty. - So far, first sweep.

1047
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,980
- On the board.

1048
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,020
- I rolled a three.

1049
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,420
- All right, this is coming from the Genus 5 edition.

1050
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,060
Category three is history.

1051
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,820
What US city's Olympic officials were indicted on charges

1052
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,020
they gave $1 million in cash and gifts to IOC brass

1053
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,900
to secure the 2002 Winter Games?

1054
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,540
We're looking for the US city

1055
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,420
whose Olympic officials did all those things.

1056
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,100
- I think it's Salt Lake City.

1057
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,740
- Salt Lake City.

1058
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,780
- I'll say this should just stop

1059
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,380
from before 2002 Winter Games,

1060
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,380
just be like all of them.

1061
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,220
- Yeah.

1062
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,020
- Only one was indicted though.

1063
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,060
- I rolled a three.

1064
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,980
- That's another three.

1065
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,020
- Oh, that's another three.

1066
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,020
What category would you like this question to come from?

1067
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,220
- Something better than the last time.

1068
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,440
- You did the Disney one last time.

1069
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,620
Would you like a junior?

1070
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,460
- Yes, I would.

1071
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,300
- Okay.

1072
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,980
Now, do you want junior trivia one or two?

1073
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,820
- One.

1074
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,460
- All right.

1075
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,140
Last one over there, so.

1076
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,740
All right, category three.

1077
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,820
There's no categories.

1078
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,740
Actually, that's not true.

1079
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,300
There are categories.

1080
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,820
Listener Sab reminded me that there are categories

1081
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,740
for junior trivia,

1082
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,340
and I had completely forgotten about that,

1083
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,140
and I was going to put them on my spreadsheet,

1084
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,020
and I didn't, so we don't know what they are still.

1085
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,060
- But there are categories.

1086
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,220
- #Teaser for the next episode of "Randor Pursuit"

1087
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,420
where I actually update this.

1088
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,720
What are the teeth made of on the sharpest saws?

1089
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,020
What are the teeth made of on the sharpest saws?

1090
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,860
- Diamonds.

1091
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,640
- It is diamonds, roll again.

1092
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,060
- One.

1093
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,820
- All right, this is also coming from Junior Trivia One.

1094
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:08,820
- Okay, what bionic parts did the $6 million man have?

1095
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,300
- Oh, geez.

1096
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,740
- The family show.

1097
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,860
- Okay, she had an ear, so it's not that.

1098
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,340
- Wow, they really want all of it.

1099
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,180
- Yeah.

1100
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:23,860
- I only watched the girl one.

1101
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,100
- 'Cause it was better.

1102
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,180
- Yeah, I know.

1103
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,540
Arm, how many?

1104
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,100
You're not gonna tell me.

1105
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,840
Arm and eye and probably a leg.

1106
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,300
- I'm gonna give it to you.

1107
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,260
It's one arm, one eye and legs.

1108
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,700
But this is a ridiculous thing

1109
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,780
that they were asking for all of it.

1110
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,620
- Arm, eye and legs.

1111
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,700
- Because he had to run fast.

1112
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,540
He could do it.

1113
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,120
(all laughing)

1114
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,180
- All right, so that's another sweep.

1115
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,020
- Wilders.

1116
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,180
All right, no pressure, Dan.

1117
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:07,300
Oh wait, do you have a d8 over there or does somebody need to pass you one? Thank you Monty.

1118
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,300
Mm-hmm

1119
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:16,180
One all right very important this is coming from the 50s and 60s edition of Chex trivia

1120
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,420
I'm tired of tech heads. What is the name of Elvis Presley's first record?

1121
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:28,220
You just put that movie it wouldn't help okay

1122
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,060
- Okay.

1123
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:34,220
Two guesses.

1124
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:39,320
I'm gonna guess, man, I don't know.

1125
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,860
I'm gonna guess Elvis.

1126
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,700
(laughing)

1127
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,620
- That's a very good guess.

1128
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,820
That is not the answer.

1129
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,660
Does anybody know this?

1130
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,020
I certainly did not.

1131
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,500
It's called "My Happiness."

1132
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,340
- No.

1133
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,060
- It's not a single or something too,

1134
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,100
not his first album.

1135
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,140
- Well, it says record, so it could be an album.

1136
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,660
- I think it's the studios and they cut it

1137
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,180
and it didn't go anywhere and he got better songwriters

1138
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,220
and yeah, it's in the movie.

1139
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,180
- Again. - Should've watched it.

1140
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,300
- All right, Jason.

1141
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,460
- Five.

1142
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,340
- All right, this is coming from

1143
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,380
the Trivial Pursuit Millennium Edition,

1144
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,780
category five is sports and leisure.

1145
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,860
How many times did Babe Ruth win baseball's triple crown?

1146
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,000
- Come on, how many times?

1147
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,160
That is not stuff that I know.

1148
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,160
Over 15 seasons, triple crown though,

1149
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,840
it's batting average.

1150
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,680
- I don't even know what that means.

1151
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,040
- There are a lot of guys, you're the leader in the league

1152
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,360
in batting average home runs and runs batted in.

1153
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,560
- Do you get an actual crown?

1154
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,760
'Cause otherwise I do not care.

1155
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,600
- You don't.

1156
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,680
- You don't.

1157
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,640
You just, I mean, you could, you might have.

1158
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,300
Batting average, I'm not sure he actually did that well in.

1159
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,440
So I'm going to say none.

1160
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,020
- The card says zero, but I'm gonna give it to you.

1161
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,860
- Yeah. - Nice.

1162
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,860
- It's not just batting average.

1163
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,960
Luke Gehrig got so many RBIs.

1164
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,580
- Well, earlier before Gehrig,

1165
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,860
he probably led the league in homers and RBIs,

1166
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,180
but I don't think he ever did batting average.

1167
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,020
- You get to roll again.

1168
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,840
- Okay, what was my number there?

1169
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,060
Does anybody remember?

1170
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,900
It was one, five, five, four.

1171
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,160
- All right, this is coming from the Doctor Who edition,

1172
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,400
the second Doctor Who edition.

1173
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,220
So you might have some Jodie Whittaker in there.

1174
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,380
Category five is, wait, no, what did you roll this time?

1175
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,420
- Four. - Four.

1176
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,020
- Sorry, five was last time, four.

1177
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,380
Years and dates.

1178
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,700
What century is it when the pteroleptiles

1179
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,060
escape the jails of Raga and become stranded on Earth?

1180
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,560
- You've gotta be kidding me.

1181
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,740
What century is the pteroleptiles?

1182
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,820
I can't even do the pteroleptiles or who are they even?

1183
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,580
- I'm not gonna answer that question,

1184
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,740
but this time I do know the answer.

1185
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,900
- I know, I know, pteroleptiles.

1186
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,200
- Can you make a noise like the pteroleptiles?

1187
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,240
- Um.

1188
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,080
- Stephen probably could.

1189
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,920
- No.

1190
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,740
(laughing)

1191
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,760
- It's the 30th century.

1192
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,660
- It is not.

1193
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,360
It is the 1600s.

1194
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,060
It was the Tereleptiles accidentally started

1195
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,760
the fire of London.

1196
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,600
- What?

1197
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,420
- They also destroyed-

1198
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,260
- Demons?

1199
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,100
What is that?

1200
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:06,920
- Visitation.

1201
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,760
- In the visitation.

1202
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,600
- The visitation.

1203
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,000
- They also destroyed the fifth doctor's sonic screwdriver.

1204
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,900
- Okay.

1205
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,080
- Those guys are jerks.

1206
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,920
I'm just saying.

1207
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,740
- Totally.

1208
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,580
- Isn't that good?

1209
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,920
Isn't the sonic screwdriver kind of leaned on

1210
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,760
pretty heavily?

1211
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,320
- That's why the producers were like,

1212
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
we're getting rid of this thing.

1213
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,400
I was like, no, I was a child, it was very sad.

1214
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,240
- And then they brought it back.

1215
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,300
- I have rolled a six.

1216
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,240
- All right, this is also coming from the Doctor Who edition

1217
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,500
of the other Doctor Who edition.

1218
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,800
Category six is-- - This game is rigged.

1219
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,040
- It is? - 100%.

1220
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,400
- Cast, crew and beyond.

1221
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,680
Which BBC department performed

1222
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,680
the original Doctor Who theme tune?

1223
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,420
And you have multiple choice.

1224
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,740
So it's either the stereophonic workshop,

1225
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,440
the radiographic workshop, the radiophonic workshop,

1226
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,420
or the symphonic orchestra?

1227
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,640
- I'm gonna choose symphonic orchestra

1228
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,560
because I hope that's right.

1229
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,760
- Last is the radiophonic workshop.

1230
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,760
- The radiophonic workshop.

1231
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,880
- That's the one I wanna work for

1232
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,720
'cause it just sounds fun.

1233
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,540
- It does sound cool.

1234
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,500
- And they're very nice fellows.

1235
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,200
- Yeah, that's a little Dr. Who expert drop there.

1236
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,040
- That's true.

1237
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
- They're very nice.

1238
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,280
- Although one of the few women in this course

1239
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,520
was at the head of that, Delia Darbyshire, who wrote it.

1240
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,060
You're right, she made it happen.

1241
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:25,020
Alright, Lauren has gone out of the hack to skip to the lead with her sweep.

1242
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,020
There you go.

1243
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,020
She's sliding right in there.

1244
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,020
There's a whole bunch of curling metaphors.

1245
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,780
She's got five, Jason has four, Dan and Monty with his own sweep have three, and Shelley

1246
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,900
with none.

1247
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,940
But it's still not early at all.

1248
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,740
It's still not over.

1249
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:42,540
We are now entering the last regular round of Random Pursuit here, where the round after

1250
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,540
this will be infinite.

1251
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,540
has judged us.

1252
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,300
Dumb wanting.

1253
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,900
I have rolled a one.

1254
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,860
- All right, this is coming from

1255
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,100
the Trivial Pursuit Millennium Edition.

1256
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,640
Category one, people and places.

1257
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,440
How many years does a governor's term last

1258
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,580
in New Hampshire and Vermont?

1259
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,620
- I don't think anybody can be governor

1260
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,220
of New Hampshire and Vermont.

1261
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,300
(all laughing)

1262
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,620
Seems illegal.

1263
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,540
Two years.

1264
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,740
- You are correct, roll again.

1265
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,580
- Wow.

1266
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,820
- Two.

1267
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:18,500
- All right, this is coming from my second newest edition.

1268
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,060
It's the Dungeons and Dragons edition,

1269
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,300
which I apparently neglected to put on here.

1270
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,620
So I don't know what the category is at all.

1271
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,060
- Oh, dragons.

1272
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,300
- Is there a letter?

1273
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,900
- No, there's a little picture.

1274
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,940
It looks like it might be spells or something.

1275
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,780
Can you look it up for me?

1276
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,820
- Spells or something.

1277
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,460
- What was your number again?

1278
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,300
- Two.

1279
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,780
- Okay.

1280
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,220
It's a book with a 20-sided die hovering over it.

1281
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,500
- Rules.

1282
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,040
- I think it might be history,

1283
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,100
like real world history of Dungeons & Dragons.

1284
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,300
- Oh, please, please, please, please, please.

1285
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,420
(laughing)

1286
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,060
But not history in Dungeons & Dragons.

1287
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,380
- There we go.

1288
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,460
Dungeons & Adventures, what is it, number?

1289
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,300
- Two.

1290
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,300
- Two, it is Monsters.

1291
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,540
- This does not look like Monsters.

1292
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,380
I think that is incorrect.

1293
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,220
- No, that doesn't compute.

1294
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,020
- Oh, well, it's the official trivia.

1295
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:08,860
- It's wrong.

1296
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,100
- It's the right page, so.

1297
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,920
- All right, well, anyway, it's yellow.

1298
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,140
Monty, this is your yellow question

1299
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,220
about Dungeons and Dragons.

1300
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:18,420
What lead designer of third edition D&D

1301
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,540
was known for his previous work on smaller press RPGs

1302
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,140
like Ars Magica?

1303
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,660
- Oh, somebody who worked on Ars Magica

1304
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,940
and third edition D&D?

1305
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,780
- Mm-hmm, yep.

1306
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,020
- Oh boy, this is going to kill me when I get it wrong.

1307
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,740
- Unless you get it right.

1308
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,440
I, I, oh boy.

1309
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,920
Third edition.

1310
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,140
I'm just gonna say Lisa Stevens.

1311
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,660
- It is not that, it is Jonathan Tweet.

1312
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,740
Yes, at least you knew the name.

1313
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,640
- Yeah, of course it's Jonathan Tweet.

1314
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,980
- All right, that brings us-- - He's a good man.

1315
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,820
- I know him.

1316
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,460
- Check that, more name drops.

1317
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,060
- I rolled a six.

1318
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,020
All right, this is coming from the Star Trek

1319
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,760
50th anniversary edition.

1320
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,040
- That's right, not 50th. - Top 50th.

1321
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,720
- 50, and this is coming from "Star Trek III,"

1322
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,120
the search for Spock.

1323
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,160
- Oh, I've only seen that once.

1324
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,380
- Well, will that be enough to help?

1325
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,600
You need to know ships, that is your category is ships.

1326
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,120
- Who are they searching for and searching for?

1327
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,760
- Who sabotaged the Excelsior's engine

1328
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,400
so it could not pursue the Enterprise?

1329
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,400
Who sabotaged?

1330
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,120
- I literally don't have anything.

1331
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,360
- Guess a Star Trek character.

1332
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,660
- But a bad one, right?

1333
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,080
- Or is this a good thing? - I'll read it again.

1334
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,080
I'll read it again.

1335
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,220
Who sabotaged the Excelsior's engine

1336
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,080
so it could not pursue the Enterprise?

1337
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,440
- So a good person.

1338
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,000
I mean, I'm not making any judgments here.

1339
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,160
- No judgment, but presumably Scotty.

1340
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,000
- It was Scotty.

1341
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,200
- Oh, nice. - In the David Gerrold book,

1342
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,040
he says, "Scotty has stolen their spark plugs."

1343
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,400
I've always remembered that.

1344
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,400
(laughing)

1345
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,640
- This also gives us a little extra information.

1346
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,800
Scotty, who said, "The more they overthink the plumbing,

1347
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,120
the easier it is to stop up the drain."

1348
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,320
So not spark plugs, apparently, but.

1349
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,040
- Yeah, why is there a drain connected to your engines?

1350
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,720
Bad move.

1351
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,280
- I rolled a one.

1352
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,760
All right, this is coming from the Globetrotter edition,

1353
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,600
which was sent by-

1354
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,640
- All questions about the Harlem Globetrotters.

1355
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,240
- This is gonna go to us as well.

1356
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,280
These are the cards that Anthony Johnston mailed to me.

1357
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,160
This is a question about North America.

1358
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,560
"Which movie hears Gene Wilder say

1359
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,680
These are the people of the land,

1360
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,800
the common clay of the new west, you know, morons.

1361
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:46,560
- Oh, he was in a Mel Brooks movie.

1362
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,280
- More than one.

1363
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,120
- It's true, he was in several.

1364
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,120
- This is where my memory is not great.

1365
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,560
I'm looking across and you're nodding at me.

1366
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,080
- Read it from our minds.

1367
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,440
- It's not coming out.

1368
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,280
- Look at Jason's eyes.

1369
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,680
The scene is playing in his head right now.

1370
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,240
(laughing)

1371
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,500
- It's not helping.

1372
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:28,920
No, I can think of Willy Wonka and it's not that.

1373
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,160
- That would be a weird scene in Willy Wonka.

1374
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,640
- Yeah, not like all the other ones.

1375
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,800
- He was talking about the usual loopers, gross.

1376
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,200
(laughing)

1377
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,880
- I think he was in the Frankenstein one,

1378
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,320
but it's probably not that.

1379
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,840
And this, it doesn't help.

1380
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,120
And I'm not gonna Liz this out.

1381
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,960
I'm not.

1382
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,760
- I mean, you did it with Scotty.

1383
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,760
- That was better.

1384
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:58,680
No, I feel like there's a Mel Brooks movie

1385
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,560
where they all sit around the campfire and fart.

1386
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,920
And I think that's it, but I don't know what it is.

1387
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,360
The Wild Wild West.

1388
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,240
- When we're playing Jeopardy at home,

1389
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,880
that is counted as a correct answer.

1390
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,120
- Ah, this is not Jeopardy at home.

1391
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,440
- And it's blazing sadly.

1392
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,080
- You are not at home right now.

1393
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,520
- That was the correct movie, but yes, I needed the title.

1394
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,360
- Well, in my heart, I got that right.

1395
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,720
- Ghost points. - Ghost points.

1396
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,200
- Ghost points, yeah.

1397
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,960
- All right, that brings us to Dan.

1398
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,320
- I need some catching up to do in this round.

1399
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,320
Four, please.

1400
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,720
- All right, this is coming from GenusFive.

1401
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,800
Category four is science and nature.

1402
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,440
What computer company went warm and fuzzy

1403
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,440
with ads featuring some of its 307,500 employees?

1404
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,520
A computer company went warm and fuzzy

1405
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,400
with ads featuring some of its 307,500 employees.

1406
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,400
And I can tell you that this edition of Trivial Pursuit

1407
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,680
came out in 2000.

1408
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,760
So it would have been before 2000.

1409
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,600
- So not Facebook.

1410
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:10,880
- Warm and fuzzy feels like a toss up.

1411
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:18,120
I don't know why, but I'm thinking Intel.

1412
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,240
- I'm afraid not. - IBM?

1413
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,080
- It was IBM.

1414
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,960
- Yeah, without any employees, it's gotta be IBM.

1415
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,600
- Yeah, and they went warm and fuzzy

1416
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,440
because they're normally all corporate.

1417
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,280
- Incorporate, yeah.

1418
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,920
- And West Valley was never pictured

1419
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,760
because apparently it was not warm and fuzzy.

1420
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,580
- But for some reason I had something in my head

1421
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:34,080
that Intel had a, it had like bunnies or something.

1422
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,960
- Well, yeah, it was the bunny suits with the little--

1423
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,040
- With the ears and stuff, right?

1424
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,240
- But they were still in their little getups.

1425
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,360
- Yeah, I don't know, that's why I was thinking that,

1426
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,520
but overthought it.

1427
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,080
- 300,000 people.

1428
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,240
- Yeah, 300,000 people.

1429
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,000
- Not anymore.

1430
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,360
- No, five.

1431
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,560
- All right, this is coming from Genus One,

1432
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,680
in which category five is science and nature.

1433
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,520
- Nature, yes.

1434
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,440
- What's the largest gland in the human body?

1435
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,880
- I feel like we actually just did this one on a podcast.

1436
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,880
The largest gland in the human body is the...

1437
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:18,600
(laughing)

1438
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,400
If it makes that sound, it's broken.

1439
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,640
(laughing)

1440
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,960
- Oh, so many glands.

1441
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,600
- Welcome to the world of glands.

1442
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,000
- All right, that's my new least favorite word.

1443
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,280
- Glands, the thyroid.

1444
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,840
- It is not, it's the liver.

1445
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,080
- Oh yeah, see, I think I did this

1446
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,240
and it was a trick question because it's an organ.

1447
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,840
- Yeah, the thyroid's like the second though, I think.

1448
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,680
- Yeah.

1449
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,880
- The liver is not a gland.

1450
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,880
- I rolled a five.

1451
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,000
- All right, this is coming from the Star Wars edition.

1452
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,400
This is another one with a picture on the back.

1453
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,240
I'm going to pass you this card.

1454
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,560
- So many pictures.

1455
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,860
- Yup, I don't know if it will help at all.

1456
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,700
So far they have not been helpful.

1457
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,520
- I don't know Star Wars.

1458
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,860
- These guys with lightsabers.

1459
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,580
- Yeah, it's two people with lightsabers.

1460
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,720
- They have lightsabers.

1461
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,180
- They seem upset with each other.

1462
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,500
- They're causing so much.

1463
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,980
- They're usually not big fans of their people.

1464
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:09,540
- All right, category five is droids, creatures and aliens.

1465
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,980
Who was separated from Luke Skywalker

1466
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,420
during the search through Cloud City?

1467
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,300
Who was separated from Luke Skywalker

1468
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,100
during the search through Cloud City?

1469
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,980
Leia? I don't know.

1470
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,820
- It is not Leia.

1471
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,220
- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1472
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,820
- You did say droids, you did not.

1473
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,940
- But it's creatures and aliens,

1474
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,100
and they're all aliens.

1475
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,260
But yes, it was R2-D2.

1476
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,100
- R2-D2.

1477
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,620
- R2-D2 is not the number, I don't know,

1478
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,980
I'm trying to make a reference between two,

1479
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,260
but nobody has two.

1480
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,220
- Segway abandoned.

1481
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,140
- Segway abandoned, abort, abort.

1482
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,880
Lauren leads, heading into the final round of this with six.

1483
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,100
Jason and Monty are tied at four,

1484
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,600
- Dan a three, Shelly with none.

1485
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,980
- It is worse to be last when you know answers

1486
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,300
to other people's questions.

1487
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,420
It's terrible.

1488
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,700
- That's random pursuit.

1489
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,540
- It is.

1490
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,260
All right, we're gonna start with Lauren.

1491
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,620
And she's going to set the benchmark for everybody else.

1492
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,020
- I rolled a four.

1493
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,740
- All right, this is coming from Trivial Pursuit Volume Six.

1494
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,020
That's right, not Gina Six, Volume Six.

1495
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,860
Category four, Science and Nature.

1496
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,700
What ingredient in microwave popcorn is being investigated

1497
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,620
for causing a rare factory worker's disease

1498
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,940
called popcorn packer's lung.

1499
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,620
And the being investigated was in 2003.

1500
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,980
- Strange present tense for a trivial pursuit question.

1501
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:28,820
- Uh-huh.

1502
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,660
- Those investigations take a lot.

1503
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,780
- Well, it's the seventh edition.

1504
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,780
They assume you're just getting the new one every year.

1505
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,060
- In the eighth edition, they had like,

1506
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:35,900
oh, it's all wrapped up.

1507
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,060
(all laughing)

1508
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:37,900
- And they went on to ask a mysterious question.

1509
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,500
- Just wanted to let you know they looked into this.

1510
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,200
- Yeah, so what ingredient in microwave popcorn

1511
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,140
is being investigated for causing a rare factory workers

1512
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,480
disease called popcorn packers lung.

1513
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:58,120
It's probably not the popcorn.

1514
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,560
- Yeah, that'd be awful.

1515
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,400
I don't know.

1516
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,240
- Probably a short investigation.

1517
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,080
- Yeah.

1518
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,400
- Yeah, they open up a lung.

1519
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,980
(all laughing)

1520
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,580
I don't know.

1521
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:18,300
So I guess it's gonna be a quick out on the next one.

1522
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:22,300
You won't have to get very many points to get any aspartame.

1523
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,780
It's the artificial butter apparently.

1524
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,740
Artificial butter.

1525
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,340
- Yeah, there's only popcorn butter and salt.

1526
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,180
- Salt.

1527
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,020
- Salt long.

1528
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:35,220
- All right, so that brings us around to Shelly.

1529
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,580
Shelly, oh, actually you need an eight sided die.

1530
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,020
Can somebody pass one to her?

1531
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,780
- Well, we have all the things we need

1532
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,140
- We're in the, I like rolling each side of the die.

1533
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:46,980
- Chex TV.

1534
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:47,820
- And we have

1535
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,940
a

1536
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:52,780
- Eight.

1537
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:53,620
- An eight.

1538
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,340
- All right, this is coming from the Chex TV trivia.

1539
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,740
Who was the voice of Harry Boyle on

1540
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,840
Wait 'Til Your Father Gets Home?

1541
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,660
We wanna know who is the voice of Harry Boyle

1542
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,380
on Wait 'Til Your Father Gets Home.

1543
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:08,220
- Do we have a date range on Chex trivia?

1544
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,260
- Chex trivia came out in 1984.

1545
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,700
So sometime before 1984.

1546
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,060
- There was that right, yeah.

1547
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,060
And I'm sorry, the category was.

1548
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,120
- There's no categories,

1549
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,340
it's just a bunch of random weird questions.

1550
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,900
- So we don't know whether this is a TV series or a--

1551
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,220
- Oh yeah, TV, sorry, it's TV trivia.

1552
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,060
Yes, sorry.

1553
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,820
- Harry Boyle, "Wait 'Til Your Father Gets Home."

1554
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,180
- Thousands and thousands of years of TV trivia.

1555
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,620
(all laughing)

1556
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,180
- Who is the voice of Harry Boyle

1557
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,780
on "Wait 'Til Your Father Gets Home?"

1558
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,900
- Wait 'Til Your Father, God.

1559
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,380
- It's in quotation marks, but they have no--

1560
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,060
- Oh, there you go, that changes everything.

1561
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,780
- They have no italics on these cards,

1562
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,980
so I'm assuming that was the TV show.

1563
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,740
- Couldn't afford that font with the italics.

1564
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,260
- I think they couldn't. - Not a show I know,

1565
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:55,660
so perhaps it is Canadian or of another country,

1566
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,140
or I'm just, anyways.

1567
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:05,300
I'm going to have to make some sort of uneducated guess.

1568
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,240
Here it comes.

1569
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,400
Coming right now, yep.

1570
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,660
(laughing)

1571
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,400
- Daws Butler, I don't know.

1572
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,800
- Good guess, it was a cartoon.

1573
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,120
- Well, they said voice, I assume.

1574
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,360
Unless it was like someone never seen or something.

1575
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,640
- Right, right, yeah.

1576
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,320
At least it's a name I recognize,

1577
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,760
but I did not know this, Tom Bosley.

1578
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,240
- Oh, okay. - That makes sense.

1579
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,080
- It does.

1580
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,040
- It was that real-- - Happy days, right?

1581
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:29,880
- Yep, yeah.

1582
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,080
It was a family cartoon.

1583
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,040
The mother talked exactly like the mother on Family Guy.

1584
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,880
- All right, so Dan, you are next.

1585
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,120
- Does Dan have four?

1586
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,040
- No, Dan has three.

1587
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,880
- Okay.

1588
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,700
- I think you and Jason are tied with four.

1589
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,540
- Oh, okay.

1590
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,380
- Yeah.

1591
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,200
(dice clatters)

1592
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,200
- Three, please.

1593
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,960
- All right, this is coming from the Silver Screen Edition.

1594
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,360
Category three is off-screen.

1595
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,400
(all laughing)

1596
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,240
- Wait.

1597
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,720
(all laughing)

1598
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,560
- It's immediately about category three.

1599
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,720
- Behind the silver screen.

1600
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,680
Just right away in category three.

1601
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,920
What did We Magazine call, quote,

1602
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,480
"A symbol of totally irrelevant accomplishment."

1603
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,840
- Oui is italicized and it is French as the O-U-I.

1604
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,800
- Oh. - Oui, yep.

1605
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,800
So what did Oui magazine call, quote,

1606
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,200
"A symbol of totally irrelevant accomplishment."

1607
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,440
(exhaling)

1608
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,520
- Do we end the silver screen,

1609
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,880
does it cover a specific era?

1610
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,220
Is there some?

1611
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,120
- It's about movies, so it's anything

1612
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,600
before the silver screen edition was published,

1613
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,440
and that was in 1983.

1614
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,920
So any movie type stuff off screen,

1615
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,280
'cause that's your category,

1616
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,280
before 1983, totally irrelevant accomplishment.

1617
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,480
- I'm gonna say the Oscars.

1618
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,320
- Also known as?

1619
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,140
- Academy Awards.

1620
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:44,980
- Correct.

1621
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,360
- Okay, it's the French, they seem snooty.

1622
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,920
We magazine was not French, it was a,

1623
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,080
it was a boob magazine from the 70s.

1624
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,960
(laughing)

1625
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,800
- My point stands.

1626
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,440
- All right.

1627
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,840
- I thought about the golden gloves

1628
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,120
because it's like, that seems too early.

1629
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,680
Also a three.

1630
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,240
Does that apply to anything in this round?

1631
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,240
Yeah, you get to choose the edition your question comes from.

1632
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,240
Well, it tanked me last time. I'm going to Star Wars again.

1633
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,240
Alright.

1634
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,240
One moment while I pull out a Star Wars card.

1635
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,240
Oh, there we go.

1636
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,240
Last one. Pass it around. It's got another picture on it.

1637
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,240
Woohoo! So many pictures.

1638
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,240
Please describe what you see on that card for the audience.

1639
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,240
Well, this is a controversial card.

1640
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,240
Oh!

1641
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,240
This is Han Solo and Greedo seated in the cantina.

1642
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,360
- Oh boy. - There's some smoke rising.

1643
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,240
- Somebody has shot. - Somebody shot someone else,

1644
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,080
but who?

1645
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,320
- And in what order? - Yeah, most importantly.

1646
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,640
- Okay, and that was category three, which is history.

1647
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,280
What did Grito say he'd been looking forward to

1648
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,540
for a long time?

1649
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,680
- Okay.

1650
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,800
(all laughing)

1651
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,640
- Oh boy.

1652
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,520
- And if you can answer in Rhodian, please.

1653
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,980
- Una gota solo.

1654
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:02,820
Um...

1655
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:07,260
- What did Greedo say he'd look forward to?

1656
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:08,820
- Okay, technically the line is like,

1657
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:12,060
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

1658
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:12,900
- Uh-huh.

1659
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,820
- Do we need something more specific?

1660
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,620
- Yeah, it's asking for something more specific.

1661
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,060
I mean, Steven's like, I don't like this question.

1662
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,560
- Objection, that's inference.

1663
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,260
- What do you infer?

1664
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:29,820
- This could be so many things.

1665
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,500
catching Han Solo, shooting Han Solo, killing Han Solo,

1666
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,900
turning him into Jabba the Hutt for the bounty,

1667
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,920
one of those.

1668
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,340
- Yes. - But which one?

1669
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,380
- Yeah. - I mean,

1670
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,060
because it's not actually in the movie

1671
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,980
and you said it specifically. - Catching Han Solo.

1672
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:44,860
- Yeah.

1673
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,100
- Killing Han Solo. - Killing Han Solo.

1674
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,940
- Yes, that's a terrible, terrible question.

1675
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:50,580
- It is a bad question because there's no predicate.

1676
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,060
- Yeah, it just says this.

1677
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,380
- Yeah, the answer should be this.

1678
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,220
- Yeah. - It really should be.

1679
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:57,180
- Sitting in a booth at a cantina with Han Solo.

1680
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,020
- Clearly. - If you said,

1681
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,300
- I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.

1682
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,220
No wonder Han shot him.

1683
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,060
- Yeah.

1684
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,380
(laughing)

1685
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,900
- Yeah, like we've said before,

1686
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:09,620
the genre editions are the hardest and the worst.

1687
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,900
- All right, we're still going, all right.

1688
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,620
- Yeah, I bet you have six.

1689
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,180
- Efforts acknowledged.

1690
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,080
- All right, this is coming from

1691
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,100
the Dungeons and Dragons edition,

1692
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,260
in which category six is something purple.

1693
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,260
- Yeah, something purple, something new.

1694
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,600
- Yep.

1695
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,400
Which of the outer planes is a morass

1696
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,460
of impermanent matter and energy with no structure,

1697
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,840
but what can be imposed by disciplined minds?

1698
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,500
Which of the outer planes?

1699
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,160
And I have to turn this freaking card over sideways.

1700
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:45,040
- I'm gonna guess the astral plane.

1701
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,400
- It is not the astral plane, I am sorry.

1702
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,760
- Is it the plane of chaos?

1703
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,480
- It is not the plane of chaos.

1704
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,320
Anyone else?

1705
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,120
- It's not the material plane, it's not the negative.

1706
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,520
- I think they changed it a couple of times

1707
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,360
in multiple editions.

1708
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,440
- Yeah, I don't know what the outer planes.

1709
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,760
- Astral and ethereal planes can't be outer planes

1710
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,880
'cause they're right here.

1711
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,440
- Frontier Airlines.

1712
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,120
(laughing)

1713
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,520
- The world of planes. - Too soon, Jason, too soon.

1714
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,080
- Welcome to the world of planes.

1715
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:11,080
- It is Limbo, also known as the ever-changing chaos

1716
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,080
of Limbo, so chaos maybe, but I don't, I don't.

1717
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,120
- Limbo to its friends.

1718
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,440
- Yes, mm-hmm.

1719
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,340
- Okay. - So.

1720
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,480
- There's only one rule in Limbo, it's how low can you go?

1721
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,320
- Exactly.

1722
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,600
- All right.

1723
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,520
- Both Monty and Jason have four,

1724
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,280
so how do you want to do this?

1725
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,360
- Roll off, dance off, then roll off.

1726
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,880
- Well, we'll go off, we'll go in order of players.

1727
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,960
I go, Monty goes first, yeah.

1728
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,840
- What is my target?

1729
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,000
- Your target, so the target now,

1730
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,160
with only two contestants to go,

1731
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,040
Lauren has six and currently with the lead.

1732
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,880
Dan ended with five.

1733
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,400
Jason and Monty with four.

1734
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,480
Shelly is sadly out with zero.

1735
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,320
So there you go. - Okay.

1736
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,160
- So you only have to get three right to take the lead,

1737
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,080
but then you have to worry about Jason coming up from behind.

1738
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:53,920
- All right.

1739
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,520
Two.

1740
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,920
- All right, this is coming from the 90s edition,

1741
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,440
1996 specifically.

1742
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,800
Category two is wired.

1743
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,120
What computer company created a removable disk drive

1744
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,000
that could read and write 3.5 inch floppies

1745
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,720
as well as its own 120 megabyte super disks?

1746
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,480
And that's all one word, capital S,

1747
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,660
capital D for super disks.

1748
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,220
What computer company?

1749
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:25,220
Okay, I'm torn between Zip and Jazz, spelled J-A-Z.

1750
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,860
I'm gonna say Zip.

1751
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:27,700
- It is neither of those.

1752
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,780
- Neither of those are a company.

1753
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,500
- Oh, they're made by Iomega.

1754
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,340
- Nope.

1755
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,160
- No, 'cause that is--

1756
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,000
- No, but it's a super drive.

1757
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:33,840
- The Zip drive didn't read--

1758
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,060
- It didn't read floppy drives 'cause I had one.

1759
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:37,540
Was it LaCie?

1760
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,380
- Nope. - Nope.

1761
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,340
- Nope.

1762
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,180
- This is fun.

1763
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,000
- Yeah. - This is fun.

1764
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:41,840
(laughing)

1765
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,680
- Gateway 2000?

1766
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,780
- Toshiba. - Dell?

1767
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:46,300
- Gateway 2000 in 1996, Jason, come on.

1768
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,460
- 1982, right?

1769
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,980
- Uh, it's gotta be a storage company

1770
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,240
of some kind.

1771
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,080
- That's a good point.

1772
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,240
- I'm gonna put you out of, nope, mm-mm.

1773
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,200
Compaq.

1774
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,040
- Compaq!

1775
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,120
- And it saved the company

1776
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,840
and made them what they are today.

1777
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,560
- But they didn't have warm and fuzzy employees

1778
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,320
to put in commercials.

1779
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,560
- All right, so that brings us to Jason.

1780
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,400
- This is the last chance.

1781
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,320
- This is going down to the snails, isn't it?

1782
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,140
- One.

1783
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,920
- All right, it's coming from the 1980s edition,

1784
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,760
the lousy only shiny on one side edition.

1785
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,000
That's the official title.

1786
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,840
- Yes.

1787
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,080
Category personalities.

1788
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:23,920
- Poisonalities.

1789
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,480
- What's George Bush's full name?

1790
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,840
- George Herbert Walker Bush?

1791
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,680
- It is.

1792
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,760
- Which George Bush?

1793
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,080
- This is the 1980s edition.

1794
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,920
- He still existed.

1795
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:34,760
Prove it.

1796
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,580
- But no one cares.

1797
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,420
- Touche.

1798
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,240
- Two.

1799
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,160
- All right, this is coming from the 1960s edition.

1800
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,000
Category two is--

1801
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,200
- What is George Bush's full name?

1802
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,240
(laughing)

1803
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,440
- No, 'cause it's entertainment.

1804
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,640
- What is Ronald Reagan's birth name?

1805
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:52,920
What was a 1928 Porter automobile better known as on TV in 1966?

1806
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:53,920
[LAUGHTER]

1807
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,240
What?

1808
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:02,760
What was a 1928 Porter automobile better known as on TV in 1966?

1809
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,440
The Batmobile?

1810
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:04,940
I know.

1811
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:05,440
I know.

1812
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,480
Car 54, where are you?

1813
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,280
Let Shelly answer.

1814
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,680
My Mother the Car.

1815
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,220
It was, which had a great theme song.

1816
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:11,920
It was on my list.

1817
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,520
It would have been my third guess.

1818
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,760
Now she is my mother dear.

1819
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,080
- My other ear is in the way.

1820
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,960
- Are we interested with some interesting scores there,

1821
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,800
Steven, huh?

1822
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,240
- Very interesting.

1823
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,560
Well, Shelly finishes zero,

1824
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,880
but we were very happy to have you here, Shelly, in person.

1825
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,120
- Thanks so much.

1826
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,800
- Monty with a nice late surge finishes four.

1827
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,160
Jason and Dan tied with five,

1828
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,200
but the winner in our first ever appearance

1829
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,280
on Random Pursuit is Lauren Snow with six.

1830
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,520
(cheering)

1831
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,480
- And she gets to be known as that,

1832
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,520
or no, no, I should say clearly, clarification here,

1833
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,840
She has the right to brag about that

1834
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,400
until we play together again.

1835
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,240
- Yeah.

1836
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,680
- This is absolutely correct.

1837
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,520
Thank you everybody.

1838
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,760
- I would encourage you to exercise that right.

1839
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,640
- Thank you everybody for joining me around this table.

1840
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,120
I wanna thank all of our players,

1841
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,280
Monty, Lauren, Dan, Jason, and Shelly.

1842
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,260
Special thanks to my scorekeeper, spouse,

1843
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:03,360
and person who drove me to this undisclosed location,

1844
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,560
Steven Schepanski.

1845
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,440
And thank you as always to our listeners.

1846
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,200
Please join us again on the next Incomparable Game Show.

1847
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,040
Be seeing you.

1848
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,620
(upbeat music)

1849
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:15,200
(upbeat music)
